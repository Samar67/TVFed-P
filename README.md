This is the repository for our paper "TVFed-P: Tversky-based Federated Learning with Personalised Loss Parameterisation for Medical Imbalanced Data". 
It explores the potential of applying federated learning on imbalanced rs-fMRI data. The used dataset isn't publicly available but can be requested from https://bicr-resource.atr.jp/srpbsopen/ .

For local training run the nn_rs-fMRI_lcl.py and for a federated simulation using Flower run nn_rs-fMRI_fed.py
